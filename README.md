# WUFC Trading Competition Portfolio Optimization Case

This repository contains a portfolio optimization project designed. The project uses historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data from 8 different CSV files to backtest a portfolio strategy based on dynamic weighting.

## Overview

The goal is to optimize a portfolio by determining asset weights at each time step based on historical return data. Instead of using a static or equal-weight strategy, you should consider dynamically updating the weights at each time step to maximize returns while limiting downside. You will be graded based on Sharpe ratio.

Good luck!
